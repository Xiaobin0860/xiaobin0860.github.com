## Tuples

A tuple is a way to organize data. It's a way to group togeter many terms
when you known how many there are.

    {Element1, Element2, ..., ElementN}

通常使用`tagged tuple`, 例如:

    Temperature = {celsius, 23.213}.
    Point = {point, {1, 2}}.

取值

    {celsius, T} = Temperature.
    {point, {X, _}} = Point.
